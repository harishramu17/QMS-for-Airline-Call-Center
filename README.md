# Generative AI-Based Quality Management System for Airline Travel Call Centers
## Problem Statement
Every day, airline travel call centers handle a large number of customer inquiries and difficulties, necessitating effective management and evaluation of call quality and agent performance. Traditional quality assessment methodologies frequently fail to capture the nuances of client interactions. Our technology tries to close this gap by using generative AI to transcribe audio files and analyze call content in depth.
## Objectives
Our main aims include:

- Create a user-friendly online application for uploading and processing MP3 audio files from call records.
- Using the Lyzr AI API to reliably and efficiently transcribe audio files.
- Transcriptions are analyzed to provide Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for evaluating call quality and agent performance.

## Step-by-Step Implementation 
To achieve these objectives, we've outlined a step-by-step implementation guide:

- ### Project Setup:
  Initialize the project, set up a virtual environment, and install necessary libraries.
- ### Building the UI:
  Create an intuitive interface with a file upload option for the zip file containing MP3 files.
- ### Uploading and Processing:
  Implement functionality for users to upload the zip file and extract MP3 files seamlessly.
- ### Integrating Lyzr AI API:
  Integrate the Lyzr AI API to transcribe audio files accurately.
- ### Problem Bucketing/Classification:
  Analyze call content to categorize issues such as flight cancellations, rescheduling, refunds, delays, staff behavior complaints, etc.
- ### Analyzing Transcriptions:
  Extract insights from transcriptions, including sentiment analysis, keyword identification, and identifying specific phrases indicating customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction.
- ### Calculating KPIs:
  Develop functions to calculate various KPIs such as customer satisfaction scores, resolution times, and agent performance metrics.
- ### Displaying Results:
  Design a visually appealing dashboard to present calculated KPIs effectively through tables, charts, or graphs.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) ##

Key Performance Indicators are quantifiable measures used to evaluate the success or efficiency of an organization, team, process, or individual in achieving their objectives or goals.

- ### Average Handle Time (AHT):
  Average Handle Time measures the total average duration an agent spends handling a call, including talk time, hold time, and after-call work. It is a crucial metric for assessing individual agent efficiency and ensuring quick resolution times, which directly impacts customer satisfaction.

- ### First Call Resolution (FCR):
  First Call Resolution indicates the percentage of calls resolved on the first interaction, showcasing the agent's ability to efficiently solve issues without the need for follow-up calls. A high FCR rate reflects effective problem-solving skills and contributes to overall customer satisfaction.

- ### Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT):
  Customer Satisfaction Score is a metric derived from customer feedback post-call, reflecting the level of satisfaction customers have with the service they received. It provides valuable insight into the effectiveness of customer service operations and helps identify areas for improvement.

- ### Call Abandonment Rate:
  Call Abandonment Rate measures the rate at which customers disconnect the call before reaching an agent. It highlights potential issues in call management or long wait times, and a high abandonment rate can negatively impact customer satisfaction and retention.

- ### Call Resolution Rate:
  Call Resolution Rate indicates the percentage of calls that result in the caller's issue being successfully resolved by the agent. It reflects the effectiveness of agents' problem-solving skills and their ability to address customer concerns, ultimately impacting overall customer satisfaction and loyalty.

- ### Average Speed of Answer (ASA):
  Average Speed of Answer measures the average time it takes for a call to be answered by an agent. It is a critical metric for assessing the efficiency of the call center operations and directly impacts customer wait times and overall satisfaction.

- ### Silence Ratio:
  Silence Ratio measures the proportion of call time without conversation, indicating possible gaps in communication or the need for more efficient problem-solving. It helps identify areas for improvement in agent-customer interactions and overall call handling processes.

- ### Error Rate:
  Error Rate measures the frequency of errors made by agents during calls, such as providing incorrect information or failing to follow proper protocols. It highlights areas for training and development to improve agent performance and ensure accurate and effective customer service delivery.
